=== SSH Protocol ===

To use desktop machine:
ssh hursth@gate.maths.ox.ac.uk

To port out tensorboard:
ssh -L 6006:localhost:6006 hursth@gate.maths.ox.ac.uk

To use department clusters (GPU?):
ssh hursth@<clustername>.maths.ox.ac.uk (doesn't always work, maybe need to be on maths internet?)
OR
ssh hursth@gate.maths.ox.ac.uk THEN
ssh <clustername>

To use desktop computer
ssh -L 6005:localhost:6005 hursth@professor-xavier.maths.ox.ac.uk


To use Google Colaboratory:

=== Training Command ===
python train.py -tr -m -u -b=128 -e=5 -c=u -s=100


=== Outstanding Issues ===
